A tiny little tip for challenges without input. You can use `,` instead of `[-]`, if you need to clear the cell quickly, as most of the interpreters (including the TIO.run one) will set the cell contents to EOF representation being zero. This makes programs a tiny bit unportable, but who cares about it in code golf anyway?
