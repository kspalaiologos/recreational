Contents:
- My Esolangs code guessing event entries: The filenames match the regular expression `[0-9]+\-[0-9]+[a-z]?\..+`, where the first number is the round number, second is the submission number, while the final, optional letter is to disambiguate entries with multiple files attached.
- My Esolang buffet entries: The filenames match the regular expression `buffer\-[0-9]+\.tar`.
- My Esolang interpreter reverse engineering challenges:
    - UM8 (2021): `UM8.exe`
    - Nuova (2022): `nuova.c`
    - Binary Forthleq Calculus (2023): `binary-forthleq-calculus.c`
- My Code Golf entries: Filenames match `[0-9]+[a-z]\..+`. The sequence of digits appended to https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/ will result in the challenge text to pop up.
